Main Insights: The project revealed that obesity and malnutrition coexist like two sides of the same coin. This dual burden is largely driven by sedentary lifestyles and lack of awareness about healthy nutrition in the population.



This project analyzes global trends in obesity and malnutrition across countries using real-world datasets. It identifies high-risk regions, vulnerable demographics, and temporal trends, providing actionable insights to guide public health interventions. Interactive visualizations and country-specific case studies highlight the causes and policy responses for each region.
